      <h2 align="center">The Story Of Serapea</h2>
        <div class="span6">
          
          
          <p><em>A Serapeum is a temple used in ancient Greek and Roman times for the worship of the God Serapis, a divine creation of the Greeks based upon the Egyptian God Osiride.</em><br />
          <p><em>One of these temples that has survived in its original form is in Pozzuoli, although larger and more famous versions were in Alexandria and Rome, along with Quirinale near the ancient Greek town Neapolis, which was the most important before Rome was built.</em></p>
          <p>Legend has it that Serapea was an extraordinarily beautiful girl, the daughter of the High Priest of Serapis, at the Serapeum of Alexandria. Her beauty was such that she was abducted by Greek merchants with the intention to sell her into slavery in North Africa.</p>
          <p>The news of her kidnapping spread quickly and all the normal routes used by the merchants were blocked, so they were forced to follow in the footsteps of Ulysses across routes solely known by the Greeks.</p>
          <p>In this journey they came to a rocky outcrop where the beautiful sorceress Circe lived. Torn by jealousy, they decided to leave the wonderful Serapea on the nearby beach of Cajeta, which is mentioned in Danteâ€™s Divine Comedy and the books of the Trojans Wars, referenced first by Ulysses and then Aeneas.</p>
          <p>As the darkness and fog of night descended on the beach, Serapea was shackled to a rock to be given up to the terrible sorceress in return for safe passage, but as the night breeze cleared the fog and the bright moon shone down, Serapea, previously hidden by the darkness, could now be seen by The God Serapis.</p>
          <p>A tremendous roar shook the beach of Cajeta shattering the rocks to which Serapea was bound turning them into precious stones and the rope shackles into fine silk like a glistening necklace shining brightly.</p>
          <p>The merchants, knowing that they had been discovered by the God, rushed to the ship to escape 'Circe', but their ship had been turned to stone.  To protect forever the beautiful Serapea three dogs were sent to guard her.</p>
          <p>To this day at Cape Serapo you can still see the petrified ship called the &quot;Ship of Serapo&quot; and the rocks known as the &quot;dogs&quot;.</p>
